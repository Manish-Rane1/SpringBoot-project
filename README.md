<b>Password Manager:<b>

1.In this project I have created an RestAPI, which receives HTTP requests from a front end client and performs the necessary actions.<br>
2.Here the task of the API is to store the data recieved from the user in a local file based database and perform CRUD operation on the data.<br>
3.In this app you can save your password and username linked to any accounts.<br>
4.Also in case you forget your username or password you can also fetch it from the database.<br>
